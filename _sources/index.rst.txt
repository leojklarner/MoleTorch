**GAUCHE** is a collaborative, open-source software library that aims to make state-of-the-art probabilistic modelling and black-box optimisation techniques more easily accessible to scientific experts in chemistry, materials science and beyond. We provide 30+ bespoke kernels for molecules, chemical reactions and proteins and illustrate how they can be used for Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimisation in 10+ easy-to-adapt tutorial notebooks.

Overview
==========

General-purpose Gaussian process (GP) and Bayesian optimisation (BO) libraries do not cater for molecular representations. Likewise, general-purpose molecular machine learning libraries do not consider GPs and BO. To bridge this gap, GAUCHE provides a modular, robust and easy-to-use framework of 30+ parallelisable and batch-GP-compatible implementations of string, fingerprint and graph kernels that operate on a range of widely-used molecular representations.

Kernels
---------

Standard GP packages typically assume continuous input spaces of low and fixed dimensionality. This makes it difficult to apply them to common molecular representations: molecular graphs are discrete objects, SMILES strings vary in length and topological fingerprints tend to be high-dimensional and sparse. To bridge this gap, GAUCHE provides:

* **Fingerprint Kernels** that measure the similarity between bit/count vectors of descriptor by examining the degree to which their elements overlap.
* **String Kernels** that measure the similarity between strings by examining the degree to which their sub-strings overlap.
* **Graph Kernels** that measure between graphs by examining the degree to which certain substructural motifs overlap.

Representations
-----------------

GAUCHE supports any representation that is based on bit/count vectors, strings or graphs. For rapid prototyping and benchmarking, we also provide a range of standard featurisation techniques for molecules, chemical reactions and proteins:

   * - Domain
     - Representation
   * - Molecules
     - ECFP Fingerprints [1], rdkit Fragments, Fragprints, Graphs [2], SMILES [3], SELFIES [4]   
   * - Chemical Reactions
     - One-Hot Encoding, Data-Driven Reaction Fingerprints [5], Differential Reaction Fingerprints [6], Reaction SMARTS
   * - Proteins  
     - Sequences, Graphs [2]

Getting Started
-----------------

The easiest way to install Gauche is via pip. 

`pip install gauche`

As not all users will need the full functionality of the package, we provide a range of installation options: 

* `pip install gauche` - installs the core functionality of GAUCHE (kernels, representations, data loaders, etc.) and should cover a wide range of use cases.
* `pip install gauche[rxn]` - additionally installs the rxnfp and drfp fingerprints that can be used to represent chemical reactions.
* `pip install gauche[graphs]` - installs all dependencies for graph kernels and representations.

If you aren't sure which installation option is right for you, you can simply install all of them with `pip install gauche[all]`.


The best way to get started with GAUCHE is to check out our tutorial notebooks. These notebooks provide a step-by-step introduction to the core functionality of GAUCHE and illustrate how it can be used to solve a range of common problems in molecular property prediction and optimisation.
